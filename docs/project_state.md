# Coinfrs Project State - July 23, 2025

This document provides a snapshot of the current project state for developers picking up the work.

## What's Been Done

### âœ… Architecture & Design
- **Data-source-first architecture**: Services organized by exchange (binance/, fireblocks/) rather than function
- **Two-layer data model**: Staging (raw) and Canonical (processed) layers implemented
- **Database models**: All core models created with proper relationships
- **Base classes**: Abstract base classes for all exchange implementations
- **Configuration**: Pydantic settings with environment validation

### âœ… Binance Implementation (Partial)
- **API Client**: Complete implementation with all endpoints identified
- **Constants**: 60+ endpoints mapped, all income types defined
- **Reconciliation Service**: Daily completeness check framework
- **ETL Service**: Transformation logic for deposits, withdrawals, and trades
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide covering all account types

**Status**: BLOCKED - Awaiting review before proceeding with full implementation

### âœ… Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL configuration with connection pooling
- **Session Management**: Context managers and dependency injection
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM implementation for API credentials
- **Environment**: Comprehensive .env.example file
- **Base Model**: UUID primary keys, audit fields, soft deletes

### âœ… Documentation
- **README.md**: Project overview with architecture diagram
- **Development Setup**: Step-by-step guide with troubleshooting
- **Architecture Decisions**: 8 ADRs documenting key choices
- **API Development Guide**: Patterns and examples
- **Glossary**: All business and technical terms defined

## What's In Progress

### ðŸ”„ Exchange-Independent Tasks
The following tasks are ready to be implemented:

1. **Authentication System** (Task 4.1)
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Google OAuth integration
   - Email OTP implementation
   - Token refresh mechanism

2. **Core API Framework** (Task 6)
   - Router structure with versioning
   - Error handling middleware
   - Request/response standardization
   - OpenAPI documentation

3. **Portfolio Management** (Task 7)
   - Portfolio CRUD operations
   - Entity management
   - Location Group configuration
   - Cost Pool setup

## What's Blocked

### ðŸ”´ Binance Implementation
- Waiting for comprehensive review of constants and documentation
- Need approval before implementing:
  - Database integration for ingestion
  - All account types (margin, futures, earn)
  - Sub-account support
  - Rate limiting

### ðŸ”´ Fireblocks Implementation
- Waiting for implementation guidelines
- No work done yet beyond placeholder files

## Next Steps for New Developers

### Option 1: Continue Exchange-Independent Work
Pick up any of the pending tasks in todo.md:
- Task 4: Authentication API
- Task 5: Database setup and migrations
- Task 6: Core API framework
- Task 7: Portfolio management
- Task 8: Testing infrastructure

### Option 2: Review and Unblock Binance
- Review `app/services/binance/constants.py`
- Review `docs/data_sources/binance.md`
- Provide feedback on completeness
- Approve or request changes

### Option 3: Start Frontend
- No frontend work has begun
- Could start with authentication UI
- Technology stack not yet decided

## Key Files to Review

### Architecture Understanding
1. `/docs/tech_spec.md` - Technical architecture
2. `/docs/architecture/decisions.md` - Why decisions were made
3. `/docs/prd.md` - Business requirements

### Current Implementation
1. `/app/services/common/` - Base classes showing patterns
2. `/app/services/binance/` - Example exchange implementation
3. `/app/db/` - Database configuration
4. `/app/core/` - Core utilities

### Task Tracking
1. `/todo.md` - All tasks with status
2. Progress notes in todo.md show what was done when

## Development Environment

### Required Setup
```bash
# 1. Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# 2. Start services
docker-compose up -d  # If using Docker
# OR
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis manually

# 3. Run application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Key Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY` - For JWT signing (generate with provided command)
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - For API credential encryption (generate with provided command)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection for Celery

## Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Frontend Technology**: React? Vue? Next.js?
2. **Deployment Target**: GCP as specified? Kubernetes?
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions? GitLab?
4. **Monitoring**: Sentry integration ready, what else?
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Redis-based? Nginx?

**Last Updated**: July 23, 2025, 22:00 UTC

This project is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. The blocked items need review, but there's plenty of exchange-independent work that can proceed immediately. The architecture is solid and extensible for future exchanges.
