18. [x] Implement deposit.py for deposit history
19. [x] Implement withdraw.py for withdrawal history
20. [x] Implement transfer.py for all transfer types
21. [x] Implement trade.py with intelligent symbol discovery
22. [x] Implement convert.py for convert transactions
23. [x] Implement exchange_info.py for daily updates

### Phase 5: Data Processing
24. [ ] Create canonical.py processor with pandas
25. [ ] Implement deduplication logic

31. [ ] Implement complete reconcile_spot() function

### Phase 7: Workflow & Monitoring
32. [ ] Create Celery task for daily reconciliation
33. [ ] Add Discord webhook integration
34. [ ] Create monitoring queries

### Phase 8: Testing
35. [ ] Write unit tests for collectors
36. [ ] Create integration tests with mock data
37. [ ] Perform end-to-end test with real API keys
38. [ ] Document test results

## Progress Notes
- Step 1-2: Reviewed existing reconciliation guide and got feedback on implementation approach
- Decided on database-first approach for symbol discovery
- Will use conservative rate limiting (50% of max) for T+2 processing
- Exchange info will be cached daily in database
- Step 3: Created detailed implementation plan with:
  - Updated rate limits (6000 weight/min, using 3000 for safety)
  - Full sub-account support from day one
  - CSV output format for testing against Binance UI
  - Raw data tables for audit trail
- Step 4-7: Phase 2 completed successfully:
  - Created binance_reconciliation.py with 15 SQLModel classes
  - Implemented all raw data tables for audit trail
  - Created v_binance_user_assets view for efficient querying
  - Generated and executed Alembic migration
  - Database now has 14 tables + 1 view ready for data ingestion
- Step 8-15: Phase 3 completed successfully:
  - Added BinanceErrorType enum for categorizing API errors
  - Implemented BinanceAPIError custom exception with proper error tracking
  - Created RateLimiter class with conservative 3000 weight/minute limit (50% of actual)
  - Added pagination helper methods (paginate_request, chunk_time_range)
  - Implemented all missing endpoint methods:
    - get_account_snapshot() for daily balance snapshots
    - get_convert_history() for convert transactions
    - get_transfer_between_accounts_main() for main account transfers
    - get_transfer_between_accounts_sub() for sub-account transfers
    - get_transfer_between_wallets() for universal transfers
  - Enhanced error handling with proper categorization of Binance error codes
- Step 16-23: Phase 4 completed successfully:
  - Created BaseCollector abstract class with common functionality:
    - UTC date range handling (T+2 processing)
    - Raw data storage for audit trail
    - CSV export for verification
    - Error handling and logging
  - Implemented all data collectors:
    - SnapshotCollector: Daily balance snapshots with UTC timestamps
    - DepositCollector: Deposit history (only successful deposits)
    - WithdrawCollector: Withdrawals + fees as separate transactions
    - TransferCollector: All transfer types (main, sub, wallet-to-wallet)
    - TradeCollector: Intelligent symbol discovery using v_binance_user_assets
    - ConvertCollector: Convert transactions as buy/sell pairs
    - ExchangeInfoCollector: Daily symbol updates
  - All collectors save raw data to audit tables and processed data to reconciliation tables
  - CSV export functionality for verification against Binance UI

## Key Decisions
- Use database view instead of materialized view for real-time accuracy
- Process symbols in priority order (stablecoins first)
- Handle invalid symbols by refreshing exchange info
- Use pandas for efficient bulk processing

## Follow-up Tasks
- Consider implementing futures and margin reconciliation after spot is complete
- Add support for sub-accounts after main account works
- Implement historical backfill for accounts with long history
