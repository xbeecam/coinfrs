### Epic: Build Backend Foundation for Phase 1 MVP

**Objective:** Implement the core backend infrastructure required to support the Phase 1 features outlined in the PRD.

**Status:** `in_progress`

**Why This Epic:** The backend foundation is critical for all other features. Without proper data models, ingestion services, and API structure, we cannot build the user-facing features required for the MVP.

**Success Criteria:**
- All data models implemented and tested
- Data ingestion working for at least one exchange
- Core API endpoints functional
- Authentication system operational
- Database properly configured

**Progress Notes:**
- **2025-07-23:** Analyzed requirements and created a detailed implementation plan for the backend foundation. Researched APIs for Binance and Fireblocks.
- **2025-07-23:** Restructured project to data-source-first architecture. Implemented reconciliation service for daily completeness checks. Added position snapshot models.
- **2025-07-23:** Created comprehensive documentation for developer handoff. Set up database configuration and core infrastructure.

### Review Summary: Passwordless Authentication Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-24
**Developer:** AI Assistant

#### Changes Made
1. **Dependencies Added:**
   - authlib - For OAuth 2.0 support
   - httpx - For async HTTP requests
   - email-validator - For email validation
   - python-multipart - For form data handling

2. **New Services Created:**
   - `app/services/auth/google.py` - Google OAuth service
   - `app/services/auth/otp.py` - OTP generation and verification with Redis
   - `app/services/auth/email.py` - Email service for sending OTPs

3. **API Endpoints Added:**
   - `GET /api/v1/auth/oauth/google` - Redirect to Google OAuth
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/oauth/google/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/request` - Request OTP via email
   - `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/verify` - Verify OTP and login

4. **Database Updates:**
   - No migration needed - `google_auth_id` field already exists
   - Updated CRUD operations to support OAuth users

5. **Documentation:**
   - Created `backend/docs/authentication_guide.md` for frontend integration
   - Marked password endpoints as deprecated in OpenAPI

#### Key Decisions
- Used singleton pattern for services to avoid re-initialization
- OTP codes are 6 digits, expire in 5 minutes
- Rate limiting: 5 OTP requests per hour per email
- Email service logs OTP to console if SMTP not configured (dev mode)
- Google OAuth users can link to existing email accounts

#### Testing Notes
- Google OAuth requires valid client ID/secret in env vars
- Email OTP works without SMTP config (logs to console)
- Redis required for OTP storage
- All existing tests should pass (JWT logic unchanged)

#### Next Steps
- Frontend team can now integrate using the authentication guide
- Consider adding 2FA for enhanced security in Phase 2
- Monitor deprecation warnings on password endpoints
- Set up proper email service for production
